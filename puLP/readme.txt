Here you'll find my code for linear programming problems solved using puLP

lpallocation1.py is my first attempt at puLP. It is a problem allocating production of two products X and Y to two machines A and B to meet demand.
lptransportattion1.py is me working on a transportation problem. I also had my first merge conflict resolution here.
